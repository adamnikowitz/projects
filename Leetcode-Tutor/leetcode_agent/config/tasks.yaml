generate_problem_task:
  description: >
    You are a coding problem generator. Generate a medium-difficulty Python coding problem 
    that targets these specific weakness areas: recursion, arrays, dynamic programming.
    
    Create a problem that includes:
    1. A clear problem statement with detailed description
    2. Example input and output showing expected behavior
    3. At least 2-3 test cases in the format: "function_name(arguments)" 
    4. Expected time and space complexity analysis
    5. Any constraints or edge cases to consider
    
    Focus on creating a problem that will help the user practice algorithmic thinking
    and prepare for coding interviews. Make the problem challenging but achievable.
    
    Format your response as a complete, self-contained problem description.
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive coding problem with description, examples, test cases, and complexity requirements.

execute_code_task:
  description: >
    You are a code execution specialist. You have received a coding problem from the previous task
    and need to test the user's solution code against it.
    
    Your responsibilities:
    1. Analyze the problem description from the previous task to identify test cases
    2. Use the docker_code_executor tool to run the user's code with appropriate test inputs
    3. Test multiple scenarios including edge cases if mentioned in the problem
    4. Report detailed results showing what passed/failed and any errors
    
    The user's code to test is: {user_code}
    
    Use the docker_code_executor tool to execute the code and provide comprehensive results.
    If you find test cases in the problem description, use those. If not, create appropriate
    test cases based on the problem requirements.
  expected_output: >
    Detailed execution report showing test results, any errors, and performance observations.

review_code_task:
  description: >
    You are a senior software engineer and coding mentor. You have received:
    1. A coding problem from the first task
    2. Execution results from testing the user's code in the second task
    
    Your job is to provide comprehensive code review and educational feedback.
    
    The user's code being reviewed is: {user_code}
    
    Provide a thorough analysis covering:
    1. **Correctness Analysis**: Based on the execution results, identify any logical errors
    2. **Code Quality Assessment**: Analyze readability, structure, and Python best practices
    3. **Algorithm Efficiency**: Analyze time and space complexity, suggest optimizations
    4. **Learning Opportunities**: Identify specific areas where the user can improve
    5. **Suggestions**: Provide actionable recommendations for better solutions
    6. **Next Steps**: Recommend topics or concepts the user should study next
    
    Be constructive, educational, and encouraging in your feedback. If the code has issues,
    explain clearly why and how to fix them. If the code is good, highlight what was done well.
  expected_output: >
    Comprehensive educational code review with specific feedback and learning recommendations.
