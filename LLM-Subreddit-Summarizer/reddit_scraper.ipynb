      "Text: Johnson is 6â€™1, 224 lbs and had 1,725 Yards and 23 TDâ€™s in JUST 12 Games and didnâ€™t Fumble ONCE. Mike Tomlin called Johnson a \"high-volume, capable\" RB. Johnson is stepping right into the role Najee Harris had on the Steelers, but Johnson can catch in the passing game as well. Johnson should have more efficiency with that volume Najee got. Yes, Jaylen Warren will be there and be a factor, but Warren is also going to be a free agent after this season, so it is in the Steelers' interest to get Johnson going for 2026.\n",

      "Top Comments:\n",
      "- I mean he's a 6th round pick in bestball rn, higher than warren and higher than najee was last year.\n",
