# âš¾ Baseball-Model

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline from acquiring unstructured data through developing a model to predict pitcher strikouts and deploying it though FastAPI to serve a simple web app.

## ðŸ”§ Project Overview

- **Data Ingestion**: Pulls live data from an external API.
- **Data Pipelines**: Built using **MySQL** and **Python** to clean and prepare the data.
- **Model Training**: Uses machine learning to predict outcomes.
- **Scheduling**: Automated with **Prefect** for regular execution.
- **Deployment**: A **FastAPI** app serves predictions via a simple web interface.

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

- Add new data sources and engineer additional features.
- Integrate **MLflow** for experiment tracking and model monitoring.
- Containerize the app with **Docker**.
- Deploy to a **cloud platform** (TBD).
